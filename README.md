# RetaBot

RetaBot is a IRC Bot built with the ChatSharp framework. It is heavilly based off of LuigiBot.

RetaBot is still a work in progress. Any and all suggestions are welcome!

## Current Commands
* slap - Slap a user (!slap username)
* dice/d - Roll a 6-sided die x number of times. (!dice x)
* help - Displays a help dialogue
* commands - sends user a command list

Retabot will also automatically parse any links posted in a chatroom. If you wish to not have your link parsed, type in 'dnp' anywhere within the same message. (Make sure there is a space between the link and 'dnp'.)

You can also just converse with Retabot, asking her how she is feeling, for the time, or just saying hi!

There are more commands to come, so hold on to your pants.
